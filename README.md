## NOTE: 
I haven't made this app by my own i just made some changes to <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android"> TFlite Image Classification App</a>


# How to make our own Model using custom Dataset ?
STEP 1: Open <a href = "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image"> Teachable Machine </a>

STEP 2: Add Image Samples using `webcam` or `upload` option. Change your classes name accordingly to the images you're adding.

STEP 3: `Train` the model and don't switch tabs while training.

STEP 4: `Download Model` using export option and paste the model files to `app\src\assets`
